## 🌐 Our Open Source Philosophy

Open Source is not just about “publishing code for everyone to see.” It’s a culture and ecosystem built on knowledge sharing, collaborative development, and collective software improvement.

### 📌 Why Publish Code in Open Access
1. **Collaborative development** — anyone can propose improvements via Pull Requests.
2. **Transparency** — open code builds trust, especially for security-related projects.
3. **Feedback** — the community helps find bugs and suggest optimizations.
4. **Portfolio** — open projects showcase your real skills.
5. **Longevity** — even an abandoned project can be continued by others.

### 🏛 Role of Communities and Foundations
- **Communities** bring together developers, designers, testers, and documentation writers.
- **Foundations** provide brand protection, funding, legal support, and project neutrality.
- **Collective intelligence** — 100 developers can create X×100 possibilities faster and more reliably.

### 📖 Our Goal
We want every project to be accessible, understandable, modifiable, and improved by anyone willing to contribute. It’s about the freedom of knowledge and the longevity of ideas.
